#### The Pulse of the Delta: Our Danube Delta Digital Twin **

We are bringing the entire Danube Delta to life in a dynamic digital environment. This powerful simulation, or "digital twin", is one of the most detailed hydrodynamic models ever created for a deltaic area.

Built on the state-of-the-art **Mike21 by DHI platform**, our model is a virtual laboratory that allows us to see how water moves through this incredibly complex landscape.

**An Unprecedented Scale:**

- **High Resolution:** The model uses over **one million computational cells** to capture water dynamics with incredible precision.
- **Total Coverage:** It simulates the complete system, from the Black Sea coast to inland wetlands, small channels and lakes, incorporating over **3,000 km of channels** (as small as 10 meters wide) and **2,500 km of dikes**.
    

**A Tool for a Sustainable Future:** This model will be essential for the science-based management of the Danube Delta. It will allow us to test solutions and answer critical questions about:

- Flood propagation and hydrodynamics.
- The **silting of lakes** and how to improve sediment flow and water circulation together with the overall ecosystem health.
- The impacts of **climate change**, including sea-level rise, future floods and the morphodynamic adaption of the delta to increased water levels.


**_Please note:_** _The animation shows a demonstration of a typical flood event. Our model is currently undergoing a rigorous validation process against real-world satellite and in-situ data to ensure its scientific accuracy._#### The Pulse of the Delta: Our Danube Delta Digital Twin **
