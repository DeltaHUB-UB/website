## New Publication: The 7,000-Year Human Legacy in River Deltas

We are proud to announce a major new review in *Earth-Science Reviews* by the DELTA-HUB team, led by our ERA Chair, Edward Anthony.

The paper **"A 7000-year record of human influence on Global River Deltas"** explores the deep co-evolution of human societies and deltaic environments. It charts a journey from the Neolithic, where deltas served as "cradles of civilization," through the emergence of city-states, to the Anthropocene, where human activity has become the dominant geological force.

### Key Highlights

**Four Phases of Interaction**: The study identifies four distinct eras: Neolithic inception, Metal Age urbanization, Common Era expansion, and the current Anthropocene.

**The Anthropocene Overprint**: Modern deltas are defined by an "anthropogenic tract"—a pervasive layer of infrastructure and pollution that overrides natural processes.

**Future Vulnerability**: We warn of increasing peril due to sediment starvation and subsidence, calling for urgent, catchment-scale management strategies.

This work provides a critical scientific foundation for understanding delta sustainability in the face of climate change.
