## About DELTA-HUB

DELTA-HUB is a Horizon Europe research project dedicated to understanding and protecting one of the world's most unique and threatened ecosystems: the Danube Delta. Our mission is to establish a center of excellence at the University of Bucharest that drives cutting-edge science and education for the sustainable future of deltas worldwide.

## The Danube Delta: A Unique European Treasure

While other European deltas like the Rh√¥ne, Rhine, or Ebro have been almost entirely transformed for agriculture, the Danube Delta remains the largest and best-preserved delta in the EU. Its complex network of channels, lakes, sandbanks, ancient forests, and the world's largest reed beds make it a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a sanctuary for biodiversity.

This unique conservation status is partly due to a fortunate turn of history; the fall of communism in 1989 halted massive plans to drain the delta for agriculture, a fate that drastically reduced the resilience and biodiversity of other European deltas.

However, this precious ecosystem is now under immense pressure.

## A Delta Under Threat

The Danube Delta faces existential challenges driven by climate change and human intervention:

- **Rising sea levels** ‚Äî The Black Sea is projected to rise by up to 1 meter by 2100, threatening to permanently flood vast areas of the delta, which has an average elevation of only 60 cm.
- **Sediment reduction** ‚Äî Dams on the Danube, especially the Iron Gates I and II, have drastically reduced the flow of sediment that naturally builds up the delta and counteracts erosion. This sediment starvation accelerates coastal erosion and ecosystem degradation.

To ensure a sustainable future, the delta's management must be guided by rigorous scientific data. Decisions made without a systemic, long-term perspective risk worsening the current situation. This is where DELTA-HUB comes in.

## Our Approach: Science, Education, and Collaboration

Our project is built on three core pillars to address these complex challenges:

1. **Cutting-edge technology** üõ∞Ô∏è  
   We are creating a ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù of the Danube Delta‚Äîa highly detailed virtual model built on the Mike21 platform. By combining advanced satellite data with on-site acoustic and optical sensors, this model will allow us to simulate the impacts of climate change and test management solutions before they are implemented.

2. **A new generation of experts** üéì  
   Romania currently lacks specialists who can effectively work with complex satellite and modeling data. DELTA-HUB is addressing this gap by:
   - Launching a new Master‚Äôs program at the University of Bucharest focused on coastal and deltaic management.
   - Organizing summer schools, field trips, and practical courses to train the next generation of delta experts.

3. **Collaboration and open science** ü§ù  
   We believe that data and knowledge should be shared. DELTA-HUB is committed to:
   - Strengthening connections between the University of Bucharest and the world's leading delta experts.
   - Making our research data and results accessible to all interested parties.
   - Translating our findings into practical, science-based recommendations for policymakers and delta managers.
